# **SAXPY in C and x86-64 Assembly**

This project demonstrates the implementation of the SAXPY operation (`A * X + Y = Z`) in both C and x86-64 assembly. It compares the performance of the two implementations and validates their correctness.

## **Project Overview**
SAXPY (Single-Precision AÂ·X + Y) is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and scientific computing. This project:
- Implements SAXPY in C using a straightforward loop.
- Implements SAXPY in x86-64 assembly, leveraging SSE instructions for optimized performance.
- Compares execution times of the two implementations on varying vector sizes.
- Validates correctness by comparing results.

## **Requirements**
- **Compiler**: GCC or a compatible C compiler.
- **Assembler**: NASM for x86-64 assembly.
- **CPU**: x86-64 architecture with support for SSE instructions.
- **OS**: Any OS supporting aligned memory allocation.
